APP IS NOT FINISHED YET

CURRENT PROGRESS (things that I've done):

-   Singup / signin (with custom (but simple) id generating on signup)
-   Ability to edit users data such as email, firstname and lastname
-   Adding users to friends list and removing them ( you can send request and wait for someone to accept or reject it)
-   Searching users from whole app
