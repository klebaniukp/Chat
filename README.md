# chat
This is supposed to be chat

THINGS that I've already done: 
  Backend:
   - User authentication
   - User authorization
   - User data storage in mongo DB database
  Frontend:
   - React routes configured
   - Halfway form working (todo: fields check, signup/signin swap, connection to backend)
